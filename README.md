## General Information


Problem Statement

A bike-sharing system provides individuals with access to bikes for short-term use, either for a fee or at no cost. Users typically borrow bikes from designated docks, which are often computer-controlled and require payment information for unlocking. The bikes can then be returned to any dock within the same system.

BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US, has experienced significant revenue declines during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this challenging market environment, the company is striving to devise a strategic plan to revitalize its revenue streams once the lockdown measures are lifted and the economy rebounds.

To achieve this goal, BoomBikes aims to gauge the post-quarantine demand for shared bikes across the nation. By gaining insights into future demand trends, the company intends to position itself as a leader in the market, distinguishing itself from competitors and maximizing profits.

To this end, BoomBikes has enlisted the services of a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes, particularly in the American market. Leveraging extensive data collected through meteorological surveys and lifestyle assessments, the company seeks to identify key variables that drive bike demand on a daily basis.

The overarching objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast bike demand based on the identified independent variables. This model will empower management to adjust business strategies in response to fluctuating demand levels, thereby meeting customer expectations and capitalizing on market opportunities. Additionally, the model will serve as a valuable tool for understanding the demand dynamics of new markets as BoomBikes expands its operations.
